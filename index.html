			Two clear findings can be observed: <br>
			<ul>
			<li>
			Year on year comparison highlights a sudden increase from 2000 till 2004 compared to the rest of years in the data set.
			<br>
			This can be explained due to "Thunderstorms, surging air traffic and a dearth of new airport runways conspired to make 2000 the Year of the Flight Delay." Source: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2001/TRAVEL/NEWS/02/01/flight.delays/">CNN news report Record flight delays in 2000.</a>
			As to why then from 2005 this "jump" is reversed can be explained in part thanks to <a href="https://fcw.com/Articles/1999/03/08/FAA-updates-plan-for-modernizing-nations-air-system.aspx"> modernization plans </a>by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of air traffic management. Specifically in 2003 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Area_Augmentation_System"> Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) </a> was activated for general aviation, covering 95% of the United States.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> 
			The second observation is that a general pattern emerges where peak months have higher average delays. The peak months appear during the year end holiday season and then from May till August, which concides with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_holidays_in_the_United_States>summer break for schools in the United States.</a>
